dont use TypeScript until you can figure out importing with TypeScript.

there seems to be a problem when trying to call the svg from constants.ts into app.ts
console errors are: 
constants.js:2 Uncaught ReferenceError: exports is not defined
    at constants.js:2:23
(anonymous) @ constants.js:2

and 

Uncaught ReferenceError: exports is not defined
    at app.js:25:23
(anonymous) @ app.js:25
