# **Minecraft Clone Game in Java**

<br>

## **Purpose :**

##### This is a Minecraft clone made in Java using LWJGL 3. It is a way for me to learn OpenGL and Java as well as a way to have fun. I am not trying to make a perfect clone of Minecraft, but rather a clone that is fun to play and easy to understand. I am also not trying to make a clone that is as good as Minecraft, but rather a clone that is good enough to be fun to play.
